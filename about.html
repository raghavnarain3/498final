<p>This project showcases a martini glass. It contains one graph with multiple annotations that change as the next button is clicked. The graph shows the leading NBA 3 point shooters annually and also showcases how far their team did in that year (e.g. Playoffs, Finals Losers, etc.). The scenes change by clicking next and show the new annotations. The annotations show how the three pointer has effected the NBA by highlighting different parts of the graph. The parameters in the visualization are No Playoffs, Playoffs, Finals Losers, and Finals Champions. The triggers are in the legend at the end of the scene that allow the user to click the fields in the legend and show only those points. </p>
